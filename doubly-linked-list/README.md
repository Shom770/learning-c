# My first project!
This is my first ever project made in C, a doubly linked list where you can insert at the beginning or append to the end. You can either print the list in reverse (from the very end, going to the previous nodes until it's NULL) and normally, where it starts from the very beginning and keeps moving to the right.

# Date
The date is currently November 8th, 2021

# Things I learned
- `strncmp` is recommended for char[] == "literal" (from `<string.h>`)
- Arrow notation is required for struct pointers.
